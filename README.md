# Centaures
Hi, in this project we were asked to realize the administration system of a company named "Centaurs". 
This company, according to the subject statement, was to compete with "The Amazons". 
It was thus a question for us to think from A to Z of all the architecture of the database of the company, 
of the application which will allow in the long run the customer to carry out his Orders and the Administrators 
to handle the database without having to enter in the code.

You can watch the demonstration video it's called "centaures.mp4"
